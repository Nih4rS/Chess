##  **Project Objective: Chess Intelligence Engine**

### **Goal**  
Build a Python-based, AI-powered system that can:
- **Ingest and analyze** chess puzzles, games, and evaluations from the [Lichess database](https://lichess.org/api).
- **Train or prompt LLMs** to provide real-time **chess advice**, **move evaluations**, and **strategic annotations**.

---

##  Core Use Cases

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
|  **Puzzle Ingestion** | Automatically download, preprocess, and analyze Lichess puzzles |
|  **Evaluation Parsing** | Parse centipawn/mate evaluations and PVs from Lichess eval data |
|  **LLM Training/Prompting** | Use positions + themes to teach a language model chess strategy |
|  **Annotation Generator** | Automatically annotate chess positions using LLMs |
|  **Sharp Play Advisor** | Suggest how to make the game more tactical when behind |
|  **Evaluation Metrics** | Build evaluation functions: material, king safety, space, activity, sharpness, complexity, etc. |

##  Foundations

### Datasets
-  `lichess_db_puzzle.csv.zst`  
-  `lichess_db_eval.jsonl.zst`  
-  (Optional) PGNs from monthly DBs

### Data Types
- FEN (positions)
- UCI/SAN (moves)
- Stockfish evals (cp/mate)
- Puzzle metadata (theme, tags, popularity, etc.)

##  Stack

| Component | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Language | Python |
| Data | Lichess API + CSV/JSON |
| Backend | Python scripts, FastAPI (later) |
| Model | `GPT-style` LLM (or prompt OpenAI/LLM models with chess context) |
| Eval Engine | Stockfish (optional integration for consistency checks) |
| Env Mgmt | `.env`, `dotenv`, `gitignore` |
| Deployment (later) | Streamlit or Flask |

##  Evaluation Metrics for LLM (Training or Inference)

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
|  Tactical accuracy | Whether the LLM recommends the engine-best move |
|  Positional understanding | Evaluates if the LLM picks moves aligned with key heuristics (space, king safety) |
|  Annotation quality | Measured by how well LLM explains key concepts or justifies moves |
|  Strategy consistency | For complex positions, does the LLM follow a coherent long-term plan? |
|  Pressure creation | For losing positions, can it suggest high-pressure tactical options? |

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd lichess-chess-analytics
Setup environment

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate # Unix/MacOS
env\Scripts\activate # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure your OAuth token

Copy .env.default to .env and fill in your Lichess OAuth token.

Next Steps for LLM Integration
Choose a suitable LLM like GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4, considering:

Accuracy in Chess move evaluation

Capability for clear strategic explanations

Efficiency and inference speed

Recommended evaluation metrics:

Move correctness and alignment with Stockfish

Clarity of move explanations

Contextual adaptability in complex or sharp positions

Security Practices
NEVER commit your .env file or OAuth tokens to GitHub.

Regularly rotate OAuth tokens.
