## 🧠 **Project Objective: Chess Intelligence Engine**

### **Goal**  
Build a Python-based, AI-powered system that can:
- **Ingest and analyze** chess puzzles, games, and evaluations from the [Lichess database](https://lichess.org/api).
- **Train or prompt LLMs** to provide real-time **chess advice**, **move evaluations**, and **strategic annotations**.

## 🎯 Core Use Cases

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ♟️ **Puzzle Ingestion** | Automatically download, preprocess, and analyze Lichess puzzles |
| 🧮 **Evaluation Parsing** | Parse centipawn/mate evaluations and PVs from Lichess eval data |
| 🧠 **LLM Training/Prompting** | Use positions + themes to teach a language model chess strategy |
| 💬 **Annotation Generator** | Automatically annotate chess positions using LLMs |
| ⚔️ **Sharp Play Advisor** | Suggest how to make the game more tactical when behind |
| 📊 **Evaluation Metrics** | Build evaluation functions: material, king safety, space, activity, sharpness, complexity, etc. |

## 🛠️ Stack

| Component | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Language | Python |
| Data | Lichess API + CSV/JSON |
| Backend | Python scripts, FastAPI (later) |
| Model | `GPT-style` LLM (or prompt OpenAI/LLM models with chess context) |
| Eval Engine | Stockfish (optional integration for consistency checks) |
| Env Mgmt | `.env`, `dotenv`, `gitignore` |
| Deployment (later) | Streamlit or Flask |

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics for LLM (Training or Inference)

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ Tactical accuracy | Whether the LLM recommends the engine-best move |
| ✅ Positional understanding | Evaluates if the LLM picks moves aligned with key heuristics (space, king safety) |
| ✅ Annotation quality | Measured by how well LLM explains key concepts or justifies moves |
| ✅ Strategy consistency | For complex positions, does the LLM follow a coherent long-term plan? |
| ✅ Pressure creation | For losing positions, can it suggest high-pressure tactical options? |
